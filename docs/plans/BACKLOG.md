## Skimmer Scrape → Export/Report Triage

**Intake rule (established 2026-05-28):** Every Skimmer (or other UI-only) web scrape produced for a client is logged here as a candidate warehouse report/export. The warehouse is the single source of truth for **source-document traceability** — a scrape is a signal that a report/export may belong in SDW. Triage each:

- **(a) Warehouse-derivable** — the underlying data is in the nightly extract → build as a `DL-` report/export and retire the recurring scrape. One lineage, auditable.
- **(b) UI-only / not in extract** — evaluate as a new `ETL-` ingestion source, *or* consciously accept it as a permanent one-off scrape.

One-off scrapes remain acceptable. This log exists so each scrape is **consciously dispositioned, not silently repeated** — and so that when a report can come from the warehouse, source traceability collapses to a single source.

| ID | Source page | Org(s) scraped | In nightly extract? | Disposition candidate | Effort | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------|-------|
| SX-1 | `/Client/Jobs` | Splashworks Ocala (= AQPS?), also exists for JOMO | **No `Job` table** — extract has WorkOrder / Quote / Invoice / Payment but not the Job wrapper entity | (a) reconstruct Job as a `DL-` report by joining WorkOrder + Invoice + Payment + Customer; OR (b) add `Job` to the ETL extract if Skimmer's SQLite exposes it | M | First scrape 2026-05-28 (139 jobs, Splashworks Ocala, $122,770 total). **Confirm:** (1) is Skimmer's "Job" entity in the 44-table extract under another name? (2) does Splashworks Ocala = AQPS legal entity? (3) is "The Pool Deck" org a 3rd entity outside the warehouse? Scraper: `invoice-entry-qbo-skimmer/scripts/scrape-jobs.js`. |
| SX-2 | `/Client/Integrations/QBO` (Activity tab) | JOMO | **No** — UI-only Skimmer↔QBO sync-event log, not a Skimmer DB table | (b) new `ETL-` source: scrape → `fact_qbo_sync_event`. See EIA sync-observability proposal. | M | First scrape 2026-05-27 (54,520 rows / 180d JOMO, 8.4% error rate). The error subset = the `rpa-disposition-agent` input queue. Ties to the EIA gap: the QBO↔Skimmer integration is marked "real-time/healthy" but has no observability layer in the warehouse. Scraper: `invoice-entry-qbo-skimmer/scripts/scrape-qbo-activity.js`. |

### ETL — Historical Accumulation

| ID | Item | Category | Effort | Notes |
|----|------|----------|--------|-------|
| ~~ETL-1~~ | ~~**Incremental fact accumulation** — switch dbt fact tables to `incremental` materialization with dedup keys~~ | ~~dbt + ETL~~ | ~~M~~ | ~~DONE 2026-03-18. All 10 facts incremental. Also fixed missing `_company_name` joins + added `service_stop_entry_id` to dosage facts.~~ |
| ~~ETL-2~~ | ~~**Load RouteSkip + SkippedStopReason** — add to ETL raw sources~~ | ~~ETL~~ | ~~S~~ | ~~DONE 2026-03-18. Already in raw (ETL loads all 44 tables). Added dbt sources + staging models.~~ |
| ~~ETL-3~~ | ~~**Load RouteMove** — add to ETL raw sources~~ | ~~ETL~~ | ~~S~~ | ~~DONE 2026-03-18. Same — already in raw. Added dbt source + staging model.~~ |
| ETL-4 | **Load Equipment tables** — EquipmentItem, InstalledItem, PartCategory, PartMake, PartModel | ETL | S | New raw tables needed for DL-6 (dim_equipment) |
| ~~ETL-5~~ | ~~**Nightly reconciliation check** — compare raw vs warehouse counts/totals, JSON report, pass/fail in pipeline~~ | ~~ETL~~ | ~~S~~ | ~~DONE 2026-03-26. 6 checks (active customers, payments, invoice items, service stops, payment totals, route skips). Runs nightly after dbt.~~ |
| ETL-6 | **Add `_loaded_at` + `_extract_date` to fact tables** — row-level provenance for incremental facts | ETL | S | Phase 2 of source traceability. Enables "when did this row enter the warehouse?" |
| ETL-7 | **Row-level trace CLI** — given a Skimmer ID, trace it through raw → staging → warehouse → semantic | ETL | M | Phase 2 of source traceability. `./cli/trace-record.sh payment abc123 AQPS` |
| ETL-8 | **`rpt_reconciliation` dbt model** — point-in-time snapshots of source vs warehouse totals with variance | dbt model | S | Phase 3 of source traceability. Auditable trail for compliance. |
| ETL-9 | **Schema governance rollout** — full CTRL-01/02/04/05 implementation on top of hotfix seed | ETL + dbt | L | Builds on `docs/data-governance/` scaffold landed 2026-04-20. Scope: (1) YAML contract loader + validator in `etl/schema_contract.py`, (2) drift detector + `etl_schema_drift` population, (3) atomic pipeline gate in `nightly-pipeline.sh` (drift → abort before any load), (4) Slack `#alerts` alerting for drift events, (5) append-only triggers + `auditor_ro` role on evidence tables, (6) `union_companies()` macro rewrite to emit explicit column lists from contracts, (7) dbt tests generated from contracts, (8) migrate all 45 Skimmer tables from pre-governance → governed (one contract file per table, reviewed PR per migration). **Policy:** `docs/data-governance/policy.md` (*Lex Immutabilis*). **Drives:** future QBO + Zoho onboarding per `procedures/new-source-onboarding.md`. |

### Security Audit Findings (2026-03-28) — Open

| ID | Severity | Item | Category | Effort | Notes |
|----|----------|------|----------|--------|-------|
| SA-M1 | Medium | SQL validation regex bypass via comments — strip block comments before regex check | Security | S | `api/services/query_executor.py`. Mitigated by read-only DB user. |
| SA-M2 | Medium | Rate limiter uses spoofable client IP — switch to CF-Connecting-IP | Security | S | `api/rate_limit.py`. Same fix pattern as IN-8. |
| SA-M3 | Medium | Metabase using H2 embedded DB — migrate to Postgres-backed Metabase | Security | M | `docker-compose.yml:64-75`. H2 has known CVEs, not backed up with pg volume. |
| SA-M4 | Medium | Audit logger shares main DATABASE_URL — consider separate audit DB user | Security | S | `api/services/audit_logger.py`. Privilege separation concern. |
| SA-M5 | Medium | Frontend Dockerfile uses `npm install` instead of `npm ci` | Security | S | Supply chain risk from dynamic resolution. |
| SA-M6 | Medium | MD5 used for ETL file checksums — switch to SHA-256 | Security | S | `etl/extract.py:39-44`. MD5 is deprecated. |
| SA-M7 | Medium | Ripple `ripple_rw` has overly broad CREATE DATABASE permission | Security | S | Pre-create ripple schema, remove CREATE ON DATABASE grant. |
| SA-L2 | Low | No CSRF token on mutation endpoints | Security | S | Mitigated by CF Access + CORS. |
| SA-L3 | Low | Unquoted shell variables in deploy script | Security | S | `scripts/deploy.sh:53`. |
| SA-L4 | Low | Docker containers run as root | Security | S | Add USER directive to Dockerfiles. Overlaps PH-5. |
| SA-L5 | Low | `firebase-debug.log` committed to repo | Security | S | Remove and add to .gitignore. |
| SA-L6 | Low | FastAPI docs endpoint exposed in production | Security | S | `api/main.py:13`. Disable /docs and /redoc in production. |

# archive-incoming.sh — copy VERIFIED partner uploads out of the SFTP jail into a
# root-owned archive.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: `incoming/` is partner-writable by definition — that is the
# whole point of a drop-off. A file sitting there is therefore not yet a backup:
# the partner (or anyone holding that key) can overwrite or delete it, and our
# only copy goes with it. Governance data we were asked to retain has to leave
# the writable surface before it counts as retained.
#
# Only files whose sidecar manifest verifies are archived. An unverified file is
# left in place and reported — we do not quietly preserve bytes we cannot vouch
# for, because a corrupt archive that looks authoritative is worse than none.
#
# THIS SCRIPT NEVER DELETES FROM THE DROP-OFF. It copies. Greenmill retains their
# uploads in `incoming/` in perpetuity and sweeps them by hand (Ross, 2026-08-06),
# so draining the directory would destroy the partner's own working set. Our copy
# is an ADDITIONAL guarantee, not a relocation.
#
# Idempotent: a payload already archived with a matching sha256 is skipped, so
# this is safe to run on a schedule. A DIFFERENT payload arriving under a name
# already archived is never overwritten — it lands beside it with a .conflict
# suffix and is reported loudly.
#
# SCALE BREAKPOINT: because nothing is ever removed, every run re-hashes every
# retained file (source, plus the archived copy on the skip path). At ~1.4 MB/day
# that is a second or two after a year and not worth optimising. If a partner ever
# drops multi-GB files daily, switch the skip test to size+mtime and re-verify on a
# weekly sweep instead — do NOT simply drop the verification.
#
# Cron — 00:30 UTC, shortly after Greenmill's ~23:56 UTC push and well before the
# 05:30 pipeline, so the nightly report reads an already-archived state:
#   30 0 * * * /opt/splashworks/infrastructure/sftp/archive-incoming.sh >> /opt/splashworks/data/sftp-archive.log 2>&1

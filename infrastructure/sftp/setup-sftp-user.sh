#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup-sftp-user.sh — create a hardened, chrooted, SFTP-only account for an
# external partner to PULL the nightly Skimmer extracts. Idempotent.
#
# Design (SECURITY_AUDIT_2026-07-14 follow-on; Greenmill file-transfer):
#   - Dedicated system user, NO shell (/usr/sbin/nologin), password LOCKED,
#     key-based auth only, primary group `sftponly`.
#   - ChrootDirectory jail owned root:root 0755 (OpenSSH requires the jail and
#     all parents to be root-owned + non-writable). The partner is dropped into
#     the jail and cannot traverse out, get a shell, or reach the DB socket.
#   - Read-only `extracts/` subdir where the pipeline publishes files. Partner
#     has read only (no write) — tighter than a normal upload jail.
#   - OPTIONAL write-enabled drop-off subdir (env DROPOFF_DIR, e.g. "incoming"),
#     owned by the partner so they can PUT and DELETE their own files. Only that
#     one subdir is writable; the jail root and `extracts/` stay root-owned, so
#     the chroot requirement holds and published extracts remain tamper-proof.
#   - Transfer logging: `internal-sftp -l INFO` records every open/close with
#     filename and byte counts, so a PUT into the drop-off is provable. Without
#     it sshd logs the login only and the audit trail stops at the door.
#   - authorized_keys kept OUTSIDE the jail (/etc/ssh/sftp-keys/%u, root-owned)
#     so the partner can never modify their own key set.
#   - sshd Match block appended to the END of the main config (Match must follow
#     all global directives; Ubuntu's Include sits at the top, so a drop-in would
#     wrongly capture globals). Reload is gated on `sshd -t`.
#
# Does NOT enable ufw — that's a shared-box change (jomo-inventory also serves
# 80/443 here) and needs the partner's source IPs; handled separately.
#
# Usage (run as root on the target box):
#   ./setup-sftp-user.sh [USERNAME] [PUBKEY_FILE]
#   USERNAME    default: sftp-greenmill
#   PUBKEY_FILE optional path to the partner's SSH public key; if omitted the
#               account is created inert (key file empty) until the key arrives.
#   DROPOFF_DIR env; name of a writable drop-off subdir (default: none/read-only).
#               e.g. DROPOFF_DIR=incoming ./setup-sftp-user.sh sftp-greenmill-ci
